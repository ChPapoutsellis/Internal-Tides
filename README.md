# Internal Tides CMS

Calculation of Internal Tides (IT) using a Coupled-Mode System (CMS) obtained
by the body-forcing formulation.

The function ITCMS calculates the IT generated by a Gaussian ridge.
It returns the energy conversion rate and visualises several flow fields.

Details on the mathematical formulation and the numerical scheme are given in the paper:

Ch. Papoutsellis, M. Mercier, N. Grisouard, Internal tide generation from non-uniform barotropic body forcing

Any comments and questions are welcome!


# Working Example
Running ITCMS in the Matlab command prompt window produces the IT corresponding to the M_2 tidal constituent with constant stratification N=0.0015 (1/s), Coriolis frequency f = 0.0001 (1/s) and horizontal barotropic current U_0 = 0.04 (m/s). The depth at infinity is 3000m and the ridge has a criticality 0.8 and relative height 0.5. The calculated energy conversion rate is 1577.26 (W/m) per unit ridge length. We show below typical figures produced by the code
