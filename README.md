# Internal Tides CMS

Calculation of Internal Tides (IT) using a Coupled-Mode System (CMS) obtained
by the body-forcing formulation.

The function ITCMS calculates the IT generated by a Gaussian ridge.
It returns the energy conversion rate and visualises several flow fields.

Details on the mathematical formulation and the numerical scheme are given in the paper:

Ch. Papoutsellis, M. Mercier, N. Grisouard, Internal tide generation from non-uniform barotropic body forcing

Any comments and questions are welcome!


# Working Example
Running ITCMS in the Matlab command prompt window produces the internal tide corresponding to the M_2 tidal constituent and a Gaussian ridge with characteristic depth of 3000m, criticality 0.8, relative height 0.5 with a Brunt–Väisälä frequency N=

# Remarks
For the colormaps we use the function cmocean.m (also provided here) written by Chad A. Greene of the Institute for Geophysics at the 
University of Texas at Austin (UTIG), June 2016, using colormaps created by Kristen
Thyng of Texas A&M University, Department of Oceanography.
