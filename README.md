# Internal Tides CMS

Calculation of Internal Tides using a Coupled-Mode System (CMS) obtained
by the body-forcing formulation describing the internal-tide generation process

The function IT_CMS calculates the internal tide generated by a Gaussian ridge.
It returns the energy conversion rate and visualises several flow fields.

Details of the mathematical formulation and the numerical scheme are given in the paper:

Ch. Papoutsellis, M. Mercier, N. Grisouard, Internal tide generation from non-uniform barotropic body forcing

Any comments and questions are welcome!


# Remarks
For the colormaps we use the function cmocean.m (also provided here) written by Chad A. Greene of the Institute for Geophysics at the 
University of Texas at Austin (UTIG), June 2016, using colormaps created by Kristen
Thyng of Texas A&M University, Department of Oceanography.
